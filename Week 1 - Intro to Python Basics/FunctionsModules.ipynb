The program should allow users to create new orders, add items to orders, and finalize orders with a total cost calculation, including applicable taxes. Each menu item should have a name and price. Inputs include commands to manage orders (create, add items, finalize) and customer choices. Outputs are the details of the order, including items ordered and the total cost. The program should also provide options for handling special requests or modifications to standard menu items and manage errors or invalid inputs effectively.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IWFeglhWsu1y"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["menu_items={\n","    \"vegmomo\":100,\n","    \"allo\":30,\n","    \"chowmin\":90,\n","    \"samosa\":25,\n","    \"pakauda\":50\n","}\n","orders = []\n","\n","def create_order():\n","  order_id=len(orders)+1\n","  orders.append({\"order_id\":order_id,\"items\":[],\"total_cost\":0.0})\n","  print(\"Order created Successfully!\")\n","\n","def add_items():\n","  order_id=int(input(\"Enter order id: \").strip())\n","  item_name=input(\"Enter item name: \").strip()\n","  if item_name in menu_items:\n","    for order in orders:\n","     if order[\"order_id\"] == order_id:\n","      order[\"items\"].append(item_name)\n","      order[\"total_cost\"] += menu_items[item_name]\n","      print(f\"Added {item_name} to order {order_id}.\")\n","      return\n","    print(\"Order not found.
